"			<dt>\n"
"			<dd>Mulberry is supported on the following Unix variants:\n"
"		</dl>\n"
"		<ul>\n"
"			<ul>\n"
"				<li>Linux x86, RedHat 5.x\n"
"				<li>Linux x86, RedHat 6.x, 7.x\n"
"				<li>Linux PPC 2000\n"

"				<li>Solaris 8/x86\n"
"			</ul>\n"
"		</ul>\n"
"		<dl>\n"
"			<dd>It has also been successfully run by testers on the following:\n"
"		</dl>\n"
"		<ul>\n"
"			<ul>\n"
"				<li>FreeBSD x86 with linux compatibility libraries (using Linux x86, RedHat 6.x version)\n"
"				<li>Linux x86, Debian 2.1/2.2 (using Linux x86, RedHat 6.x version)\n"

"			<dt><a name=\"launchurls\"></a><b>How do I make URL links launch an application when I click on them?</b>\n"
"			<dt>\n"
"			<dd>Mulberry can launch applications associated with URL schemes by using a mapping file that you provide for it. Mulberry looks for mapping files in the following locations (if they exist):\n"
"		</dl>\n"
"		<ul>\n"
"			<ul>\n"
"				<li type=\"circle\"><tt>/usr/lib/url.helpers</tt>\n"
"				<li type=\"circle\"><tt>/usr/local/lib/url.helpers</tt>\n"
"				<li type=\"circle\"><tt>/etc/url.helpers</tt>\n"
"				<li type=\"circle\"><tt>~/.url.helpers</tt>\n"
"			</ul>\n"
"		</ul>\n"
"		<dl>\n"
"			<dd>If more than one file exists, Mulberry reads in the entries in each file determined by the order above, and duplicate entries are replaced. Thus an entry in <tt>/etc/url.helpers</tt> will be overridden by an equivalent entry in <tt>~/.url.helpers</tt> allowing users to override site defaults with their own settings, if required.\n"
"			<dd>\n"
"			<dd>The mapping file has the following format for each line, which represents a single entry, and can include as many entries as needed:\n"
"			<dd>\n"
"			<dd><tt>&lt;url_scheme&gt; &lt;tab&gt; &lt;command&gt;</tt>\n"
"			<dd>\n"
"			<dd>The URL can be substitued in the command by using the text <tt>%s</tt>.\n"
"			<dd>For example:\n"
"			<dd>\n"
"			<dd><tt>http<nobr> browser %s</nobr></tt>\n"
"			<dd>\n"
"			<dd>This would launch the application <tt>browser</tt> when an http link is clicked in Mulberry. Mulberry passes the URL on the command line when launching the application.\n"
"			<dd>\n"
"			<dd>You can use a scheme called '<tt>*</tt>' to match any scheme. This allows a 'generic' URL helper application to be launched if needed.\n"

"			<dt><a name=\"mimetypes\"></a><b>What does Mulberry do with attachments and MIME types?</b>\n"
"			<dd>\n"
"			<dd>Mulberry uses a MIME type to file extension mapping scheme to determine what MIME to use for outgoing attachments, and determine which file extension should be used for incoming attachments. Mulberry looks for mapping files in the following locations (if they exist):\n"
"		</dl>\n"
"		<ul>\n"
"			<ul>\n"
"				<li type=\"circle\"><tt>/usr/lib/mime.types</tt>\n"
"				<li type=\"circle\"><tt>/usr/local/lib/mime.types</tt>\n"
"				<li type=\"circle\"><tt>/etc/mime.types</tt>\n"
"				<li type=\"circle\"><tt>~/.mime.types</tt>\n"
"			</ul>\n"
"		</ul>\n"
"		<dl>\n"
"			<dd>If more than one file exists, Mulberry reads in the entries in each file determined by the order above, and duplicate entries are replaced. Thus an entry in <tt>/etc/mime.types</tt> will be overridden by an equivalent entry in <tt>~/.mime.types</tt> allowing users to override site defaults with their own settings, if required.\n"
"			<dd>\n"
"			<dd>The mapping file has the following format for each line, which represents a single entry, and can include as many entries as needed:\n"
"			<dd>\n"
"			<dd><tt>&lt;mime_type&gt; &lt;tab&gt; &lt;comma separated list of extensions&gt;</tt>\n"
"			<dd>\n"
"			<dd>For example:\n"
"			<dd>\n"
"			<dd><tt>image/jpeg jpg jpeg</tt>\n"
"			<dd>\n"
"			<dd><font size=\"2\"><b>Outgoing attachments</b></font>\n"
"			<dd>For outgoing attachments, Mulberry looks to see if the attached file has a file extension. If it does, Mulberry looks up the extension in the mime mappings databse. If a mapping is found, that MIME type/subtype is assigned to the attachment. If no extension exists in the file name, or there is no mapping for the extension, Mulberry defaults to using application/octet-stream for the attachment.\n"
"			<dd>\n"
"			<dd><font size=\"2\"><b>Incoming attachments</b></font>\n"
"			<dd>For incoming attachments, Mulberry will try and remap or add a file extension to the incoming attachment name using the following rules. If an entry for the MIME type/subtype exists in the MIME database, Mulberry looks to see whether the extension on the incoming attachment matches any of those associated with the MIME type/subtype. If there is a match, the incoming attachment name is not changed. If there is no match, Mulberry will change the incoming attachment name to have the first extension listed for that MIME type/subtype. If the incoming MIME type/subtype is application/octet-stream, this remapping does not occur.\n"

"			<dt><a name=\"autodial\"></a><b>How do I set up automatic modem dial/hangup?</b>\n"
"			<dd>\n"
"			<dd>Mulberry does its best to determine what kind of internet connection you have and whether one is active when it starts up. If no connection is present it can execute a command to try and make a connection. This will typically create a pppd process to make a ppp connection via a modem.\n"
"			<dd>\n"
"			<dd>To make automatic dialling/hangup active, you need to have the 'Automatic Modem Dial/Hagup' option on in Mulberry's Mailbox&gt;Disconnected preferences panel. You also need to have a file called <tt>.auto_dial</tt> present in your default Mulberry directory (usually <tt>~/.mulberry</tt>). This file should contain a single line with the command to execute in order to initiate the connection. e.g.:\n"
"			<dd>\n"
"			<dd><tt>pppd call myisp</tt>\n"
"			<dd>\n"
"			<dd>Mulberry will execute this command to intitiate the pppd process. It then waits for a suitable network interface to become available or for the created process to terminate. If the process terminates, the auto-dial fails. If an interface becomes available, the auto-dial succeeds.\n"
"			<dd>\n"
"			<dd>When an auto-hangup occurs (for example when you disconnect with the appropriate preference turned on) Mulberry will terminate the process created by the auto-dial using a SIGINT signal.\n"

"			<dd>\n"
"			<dd>Mulberry can use the esound and audiofile libraries to play sounds. If these libraries are installed, you can simply type a path to a sound file in the Alerts preferences panel In Mulberry to have that sound played when the alert triggers.\n"

"			<dt>\n"

To change the default from US Letter, simply change the environment variable before launching Mulberry. Valid settings for the environment variable are:\n"

"			<dd>\n"
"			<dd>Mulberry uses the mailcap MIME type to application mapping scheme to determine what application to use for viewing an attachment. The standard mailcap file format is described in RFC1524. Mulberry looks for mailcap files in the following locations (if they exist):\n"
"		</dl>\n"
"		<ul>\n"
