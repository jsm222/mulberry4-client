In simple terms, a cabinet is a collection of aliases to different mailboxes. The server pane displays cabinets at the top of the mailbox list section, before any mail servers or mailboxes. Cabinets can not be displayed in individual server windows, only the main server window or in the 3-pane window's server pane. You can control which cabinets are displayed using the Cabinet popup menu in the toolbar. To display a cabinet, click on the Cabinet popup menu and select a cabinet name. Cabinets that are currently displayed have a check mark in front of their name. To hide a cabinet, click on the popup menu and select the appropriate cabinet name again.</font></p>		</div>		<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial">Mulberry comes with several pre-defined cabinets. You can also create as many of your own cabinets as you like.

When multiple mail server accounts are defined, Mulberry will prepend the server name and a colon (:) to the mailbox names within a cabinet.

Then, simply find the mailbox(es) that you wish to add to the cabinet and drag the icon for the mailbox(es) onto the appropriate cabinet icon.

Mulberry will prompt you for a name for the new cabinet. User-defined cabinets are listed after the pre-defined cabinets in the order that they are created. You can create as many cabinets as you like.</font>		</dl>		<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial">In addition to individual mailbox aliases, cabinets can also contain 'wildcard' items. These items allow you to quickly add the contents of an entire mailbox hierarchy to a cabinet. For example, you might want all of the folders in your INBOX hierarchy to appear in the 'Copy Messages To' cabinet. One way to set this up would be to select all of the folders in your INBOX hierarchy and drag them to the 'Copy Messages To' cabinet. Unfortunately, if you were to then create a new mailbox in your INBOX hierarchy, you would have to remember to also add that new folder to the 'Copy Messages To' cabinet. An elegant solution for this problem is to place a single wildcard entry for the 'INBOX.*' hierarchy into the 'Copy Messages To' cabinet. 'Wildcard' entries are dynamic&nbsp;&#150;&nbsp;every time they are needed, the full list of matching mailboxes is determined and substituted for the 'wildcard' entry. Thus any changes to the mailbox hierarchy will always be picked up by the 'wildcard' entry.</font></p>		<dl>			<dt><font face="Helvetica,Arial">To add a 'wildcard' entry to a cabinet</font>			<dd><font face="Helvetica,Arial">Click once on the appropriate cabinet and select Cabinets&gt;New Wildcard Item&#133; from the <a href="../menus/mailbox.htm" target="_self">Mailbox menu</a>.</font>		</dl>		<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial">You can modify a wildcard item within a cabinet by clicking once on the wildcard item and selecting Cabinets&gt;Edit Wildcard Item&#133; from the <a href="../menus/mailbox.htm" target="_self">Mailbox menu</a>, or by double-clicking on the wildcard item. A dialog box will appear, allowing you to specify a new path for the wildcard item.</font></p>		<center>			<p><font face="Helvetica,Arial">			<table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="0" width="75%">				<tr>					<td valign="top" bgcolor="#cccccc"><b>Note</b> The mailbox aliases within a cabinet function in a manner very similar to the actual mailboxes they represent. Double-clicking on a mailbox alias will open a separate mailbox window for the associated mailbox. If you attempt to remove a cabinet item using the Delete&#133; command from the Mailboxes menu, you will be asked whether you want to delete the mailbox alias or the actual mailbox associated with the alias.</td>				</tr>			</table>		</center>	</body></html>
